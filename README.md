Docker container to launch Junos vMX 17.4 and newer versions on baremetal compute nodes. While the Junos control plane (VCP) runs on top of Qemu-kvm, the forwarding plane (VFP/RIOT) runs natively in the container:

```                                          
       +------------------------------+
       |  +-------------+             |
       |  |  Junos VCP  |             |
       |  |  qcow2 VM   |             |
       |  +-------------+             |
       |  +-------------+  +--------+ |
       |  | qemu-system |  |  riot  | |
       |  +-------------+  +--------+ |
       +------------------------------+
```

## Features

- vMX runs in light mode via attached container network interfaces
- Orchestration via docker-compose and manual launch via 'docker run'
- Container waits for networking interfaces to be attached to container
- Supports all Docker network plugins, including macvlan and overlays
- vMX VCP (Junos control plane) runs on top of qemu within the container
- Forwarding engine (riot) is downloaded from the VCP image at runtime and launched 
- vMX runs in light-mode (no SR-IOV support)
- Virtual network names are learned at runtime from Docker (via socket) and used to provision the interface description via ephemeral DB
- Management interface fxp0, root password and ssh public key for root and the user launching the container are learned at runtime and added to an Junos apply-group openjnpr-container-vmx
- If no Junos configuration file is provided, the apply-group openjnpr-container-vmx is used
- The virtual network list is sorted by network name at runtime (to work around the unpredictable order with docker-compose). This requires docker socket access from the container (provided via volume mount)
- Auto-installation of provided license keys
- Loading of optional Junos configuration file at startup 
- Auto-configuration of ssh and netconf
- Assigned IP address to container becomes the IP address of fxp0 
- Serial console and RIOT messages are available in the container console via [docker attach](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/attach/) and via [docker logs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/logs/).
- Load custom YANG schema, deviation and action script at startup

## Minimum Requirements

- Linux based compute node with a Linux kernel 4.4.0 and kvm hardware acceleration
- CPU must be of family Ivy Bridge or newer (released 2013)
- Container requires privileged mode (to access hugepages, required by riot)
- Memory hugepages provisioned (1GB per vMX)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker) 17.03 or newer (e.g. ubuntu package docker.io)
- [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) (e.g. ubuntu package docker-compose)
- junos-vmx-x86-64-17.4R1.16.qcow2 image, extracted from the vmx-bundle-*tgz file available at https://www.juniper.net/support/downloads/?p=vmx or as an eval download from https://www.juniper.net/us/en/dm/free-vmx-trial/ (registration required)

## Getting Started

### Required compute host packages

In order to build and launch the containers, the following packages must be installed. Example shown for ubuntu 18.04, adjust accordingly:

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install make git docker.io docker-compose
```

### Clone this repo

```
$ pwd
/home/lab
$ git clone https://github.com/Juniper/OpenJNPR-Container-vMX.git
$ cd OpenJNPR-Container-vMX
```

### Download and extract Junos-vmx-x86-*.qcow2

Download and unpack the qcow2 image from a vmx-bundle-*.tgz file from  https://www.juniper.net/support/downloads/?p=vmx or as an eval download from https://www.juniper.net/us/en/dm/free-vmx-trial/ (registration required):

```
$ pwd
/home/lab/OpenJNPR-Container-vMX
tar zxf vmx-bundle-18.2R1.9.tgz
$ mv vmx/images/junos-vmx-x86-64-18.2R1.9.qcow2 .
$ rm -rf vmx
```

No other file is required from the bundle, hence it is ok to remove the extracted files. 

### Adjust docker-compose.yml

Adjust the environment variables IMAGE for vmx1 and vmx2 to match the qcow2 filename. 

If the junos version is 18.2R1 or newer, make sure to use the container image juniper/openjnpr-container-vmx:bionic. For any Junos version 18.1 and older, use the container image juniper/openjnpr-container-vmx:trusty.

If left unchanged, the compoe file expects junos-vmx-x86-64-18.2R1.9.qcow2 and junos-vmx-x86-64-18.1R1.9.qcow2 to be present in the current directory.

### riot worker cores

If many instances are launched, its recommended to distribute the cpu worker cores used by riot by setting WORKER_CORE to different
core numbers. The value given is the cpu number (not count).

### Enable hugepages

Define at least 1024 x 2MB hugepages or 2 x 1GB hugepages via kernel options by adding 

```
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="default_hugepagesz=1G hugepagesz=1G hugepages=2"
```

or

```
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="hugepages=1024"
```

to the file /etc/default/grub, followed by running update-grub and reboot:

```
$ sudo update-grub
$ reboot
```

Once the system is back, check the availability of hugepages (the example shown has 16x1GB pages reserved):

```
$ cat /proc/meminfo |grep Huge
AnonHugePages:         0 kB
ShmemHugePages:        0 kB
HugePages_Total:      16
HugePages_Free:       16
HugePages_Rsvd:        0
HugePages_Surp:        0
Hugepagesize:    1048576 kB
```

Note: hugepages are no longer required. riot is launched with --no-huge 

### ssh public/private keypair

Create or check the presence of a ssh public/private, rsa based key pair, typically located in ~/.ssh/:

```
$ ls ~/.ssh/
authorized_keys  id_rsa  id_rsa.pub  known_hosts
```

The content of the id_rsa.pub file will automatically be used to create a login user within the Junos configuraiton file at runtime, allowing you to ssh into the vMX instance without password. 

To create a fresh keypair, use the following command and accept all defaults:

```
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
```

### Custom YANG support

Place you custom YANG schema, deviation files and action script files in the same location
as the config nd name them via these environment variables in your docker-comose.yml file:

```
YANG_SCHEMA="l2vpn.yang"
YANG_DEVIATION="l2vpn-dev.yang"
YANG_ACTION="l2vpn.slax"
YANG_PACKAGE="custom-l2vpn"
```

These files will be automatically added to the config drive together with an execution 
script to activate them prior to loading and checking the provided Junos configuration.

### Build the container

This step is optional, as pre-built containers will automatically be downloaded from Docker Hub. To build the containers locally, use 'make build', then check the binary containers via 'docker images':

```
$ make build
...
Successfully tagged juniper/openjnpr-container-vmx:bionic
...
Successfully tagged juniper/openjnpr-container-vmx:trusty

$ docker images | head -3

juniper/openjnpr-container-vmx                  trusty                                     8436770a23eb        1 minute ago         597MB
juniper/openjnpr-container-vmx                  bionic                                     7a85db4edd94        1 minute ago         428MB
```

### Launch the containers

Time to launch the images. The vmx1 has a config file in the repo directory: [vmx1.conf](vmx.1conf), which only contains a single apply-group line. The group itself is auto-generated at runtime. vmx2 doesn't have a config file, hence the apply-group statement is auto-generated. This gives the user flexibility to use or not use the auto-generated configuration group.
IMPORTANT: You must run make as non-root user. Otherwise the public key won't allow automatic access. 

```
$ make up
$ make up
docker-compose up -d
Creating network "openjnprcontainervmx_net-c" with the default driver
Creating network "openjnprcontainervmx_net-b" with the default driver
Creating network "openjnprcontainervmx_net-a" with the default driver
Creating network "openjnprcontainervmx_mgmt" with the default driver
Creating openjnprcontainervmx_vmx2_1 ... done
Creating openjnprcontainervmx_vmx1_1 ... done
```

If all went well, you should see 2 running containers via 'docker ps':

```
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                   COMMAND                 CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                                                         NAMES

```

If nothing is shown, then the containers likely terminated in error. Their logs are still available and provide details. The container names can be seen via 'docker ps -a' (show also terminated containers). Use 'docker logs <container>' to get more info's. the log shown here is from a healthy container:

```

Use 'make ps' or ''./getpass.sh' to get the containers IP address and auto-generated root password (only required if the ssh id_rsa.pub key was missing):

```
./getpass.sh
vMX openjnprcontainervmx_vmx1_1 (172.21.0.2) 18.2R1.9 deica3ootiojohsha5Eethae 	 ...
vMX openjnprcontainervmx_vmx2_1 (172.21.0.3) 18.1R1.9 eihaekahpeetungeekeerohr 	 ...
```

The '...' at the end of each line indicate, that the vMX aren't fully operational yet. Repeat above step until it says 'ready':

```
$ ./getpass.sh
vMX openjnprcontainervmx_vmx1_1 (172.21.0.2) 18.2R1.9 deica3ootiojohsha5Eethae 	 ready
vMX openjnprcontainervmx_vmx2_1 (172.21.0.3) 18.1R1.9 eihaekahpeetungeekeerohr 	 ready
```

This takes typically less than 5 minutes.
Ready means the vMX is up and running and the forwarding engine is operational with interfaces attached. See section 'Troubleshooting' if it doesn't get ready.

A successful tail of docker log output will show port status changed to up:

## Troubleshooting

### Amensia mode (no config loaded)

If the vMX end up in Amnesia, most likely the kernel doesn't have the loop module loaded yet. Haven't found a workaround yet to this, other than loading that module on the Docker host via

```
$ sudo modprobe loop
```

Based on your linux distribution, it is possible to make this change persistent by placing the word 'loop' in the file /etc/modules.

Stop the containers, e.g. with 'docker-compose down' or 'make down' and launch them again.

### check the container log for issues

```
$ docker logs openjnpr-container-vmx_vmx1_1
```

Then look for possible errors. A common one is when the provided junos configuration can't be committed. Search for 'Creating initial configuration' and see if there are any errors. 

You can also log into the serial console of the router via

``` 
$ make ps
$ docker attach openjnpr-container-vmx_vmx1_1
```

Hit enter and log in as root, using the password you can copy-paste from the output of 'make ps' command run before. To get out of the console session, hit ^P^Q.


### No hugepages

Check if you have enough allocated hugepges left via

```
$ cat /proc/meminfo |grep Huge
AnonHugePages:         0 kB
ShmemHugePages:        0 kB
HugePages_Total:      16
HugePages_Free:       16
HugePages_Rsvd:        0
HugePages_Surp:        0
Hugepagesize:    1048576 kB
```

The actual amount in MB is Hugepagesize x HugePages_Free / 1024. In the example output that would be 16GB.

### Distribute vmxt process on different cores

Prior to 17.4, the launch script tries to randomize the cpu core assigned to the process vmxt (J-KERN). 
You can limit the number of cores via the env variable NUMCPUS. The number of worker cores used by riot 
will be NUMCPUS-3. 

With 17.4, the process makes use of a configuration file in /etc/vmxt/init.conf to control the cpus used.
This file can be provided via the env variable VMXT at launch, pointing to a file that will be used if present.
This file doesn't seem to be used by 18.1 and newer versions.

```
$ cat vmxt.conf
ukern_cpu="2,4,6"
```

and referenced via docker-compose (only VMXT shown):

```
environment:
   - VMXT=vmxt.conf
```

This will limit vmxt to use just cores 2,4 and 6.
